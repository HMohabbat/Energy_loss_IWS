# Energy Dissipation in Intermittent Water Supplies Depends on Household Behaviour (2024)

#### Authors: Hamidreza Mohabbat, David D.J. Meyer

### Summary:
The current repository is supporting the publication titled "Energy Dissipation in Intermittent Water Supplies Depends on Household Behaviour." The accomponied modeling code uses
the EPA-WNTR package (an implementation of EPANET in Python) and build a series of nominal Intermittent Water Supply (IWS) Networks. The objective of the publication, thus the code is to study the energy loss values in IWS networks. 

### Required Packages: 
The notebooks avaialble in this repository use a series of packages, please ensure that latest versions of these packages are installed within the environmnet running the script. Here are the list of required packages in alphabetical order:  
**matplotlib:** For plotting and visualisation,  
**Numpy:** For numerical calculations,  
**Pandas:** For dataframe handling package,  
**SciPy:** For the optimization and model calibration,  
**WNTR:** Water Network Tool For Resilience: Used to run EPANET files
